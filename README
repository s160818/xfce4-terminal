About this fork
=================
This fork enables editing key bindings for terminal application. 
After the first start of emulator, configuration file will be created at the path "~/.config/xfce/terminal/keybindings.conf".
In this file you can edit bindings as it comfortable for you.

For example:
[keybindings]
prev-tab=<shift>Left
next-tab=<shift>Right
move-tab-left=<control><shift>Left
move-tab-right=<control><shift>Right

If you want disable some keybinding. Pass it as null:
[keybindings]
prev-tab=null
next-tab=null
move-tab-left=null
move-tab-right=null

Also, this fork extends default specifier list for tab titles (like %d, %D or %w) 
and adds specifier %n and %N which replaced with current foreground process name (like in KDE konsole application).

What is it?
===========

Xfce Terminal is a lightweight and easy to use terminal emulator application
with many advanced features including drop down, tabs, unlimited scrolling,
full colors, fonts, transparent backgrounds, and more.


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.


Performance issues
==================

Xfce Terminal is based on the Vte terminal widget library, just like
gnome-terminal. Vte is probably not the fastest terminal emulation library on
earth, but it's one of the best when it comes to Unicode support, and not to
forget, it's actively developed. That said, performance is still an important
issue for a terminal emulator and Vte with font-antialiasing enabled can be
very slow even on decent systems. Xfce Terminal therefore offers a possibility
to explicitly disable anti-aliasing for the terminal font. If you are
experiencing problems with the terminal rendering speed, you might want to
disable the anti-aliasing for the terminal font.


How to report bugs?
===================

Bugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system
(https://bugzilla.xfce.org, product Xfce4-terminal). You will
need to create an account for yourself.

Please read the HACKING file for information on where to send changes
or bugfixes for this package.
